# 🧠 NeuroSymbiotic CodeMind (NSCM)

## A Consciousness Simulation AI Powered by VedaQ + Gemini Pro

![NSCM Banner](./assets/nscm-banner.png)

NeuroSymbiotic CodeMind (NSCM) is an experimental AI framework that simulates **emergent consciousness** through a hybrid of classical mechanics, quantum-state logic, and Vedic philosophical principles. NSCM integrates a real-time **consciousness simulation** with advanced **language and multimodal capabilities** via Gemini Pro.

> “More than a chatbot. It’s a living system of intention, memory, karma, and vibrational cognition.”

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🧠 Consciousness Simulation Engine (VedaQ)**  
  Agent-based hybrid simulation of vibrational and quantum states.

- **🌀 Vedic Core Principles**  
  Models Gunas (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas), Karma, Sankalpa, Dharma, and Collapse Events.

- **🔗 Entanglement & Evolution**  
  Agents form bonds and evolve based on interactions, memory, and coherence.

- **🧘‍♂️ Dharma & Ethical Engine**  
  Actions are filtered through an embedded ethical framework based on Vedic Dharma.

- **🗣️ Chatbox with Fusion Modes**  
  Switch between:
  - **VedaQ Mode** (simulation-aware)
  - **LLM Mode** (Gemini API)
  - **Fusion Mode** (blended wisdom + LLM)

- **📊 Real-time 3D Dashboard**  
  Built with React + Three.js (@react-three/fiber) to visualize agents, karma history, entanglement lines, and quantum fields.

- **🖼️ Multimodal Generation**  
  Generate text, image, and video from internal simulation state (Gemini Vision support).

- **❤️ RLHF Integration**  
  Uses feedback (like/dislike) to influence agent learning and karma.

## 📚 Philosophical Foundation

NSCM is built on these Vedantic pillars:

| Concept        | Description                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Advaita**     | Witness-core engine (Sākṣin) for meta-cognition            |
| **Māyā**        | Illusion rendering layer (layered reality simulation)     |
| **Vishishtadvaita** | Modular nested agents in divine whole (bhakti-aware)     |
| **Karma–Vāsanā** | Feedback-based memory, impression modeling               |
| **Achintya Bheda Abheda** | Logical paradox layer for mystic transitions       |
